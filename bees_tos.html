				<h3>CLOUDBEES – TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>

				<p>
					<i>Last updated: July 28th, 2010</i>
				</p>

				<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>

				<p>CloudBees, Inc (referred to here as “CloudBees”) provides its
					Service (as defined below) to You through its web site located at
					www.cloudbees.com (the “Site”), subject to this Terms of Service
					agreement (“TOS”). By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using
					the Service or Site, You acknowledge that you have read,
					understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS. If You are entering
					into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, You
					represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its
					affiliates to these TOS, in which case the terms “You” or “Your”
					shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have
					such authority, or if You do not agree with these TOS, You must not
					accept these TOS and may not use the Service.</p>
				<p>CloudBees may change this TOS from time to time without prior
					notice. You can review the most current version of this TOS at any
					time at http://www.cloudbees.com/company-TOS.cb. The revised terms
					and conditions will become effective upon posting and if You use
					the Service after that date, we will treat your use as acceptance
					of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is
					not acceptable to You, your only remedy is to stop accessing and
					using the Service.</p>

				<h3>Description of Service</h3>
				<p>The “Service” includes (a) the Site, and all the services
					made available via the Site, in particular the on-demand
					Jenkins-as-a-Service (referred to here as “JaaS”) system, the
					Repository management system, the Support, User Forums and
					Knowledge Base systems, and (b) all software, data, text, images,
					sounds, video, and content made available through the Site or
					Services, collectively referred to as the “Content”. Any new
					features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to
					this TOS.</p>

				<h3>General Conditions / Access and Use of the Service</h3>
				<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, You may
					access and use the Service only for Your internal business purposes
					as contemplated by the Agreement. You shall not (a) license,
					sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign,
					distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make
					the Service available to any third party, other than as expressly
					permitted by this TOS; (b) use the Service to process data on
					behalf of any third party, or (c) use the Service in any unlawful
					manner or in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the
					integrity or performance of the Service and its components.</p>
				<p>Subject only to the limited right to access and use the
					Service expressly granted to You under this TOS, all rights, title
					and interest in and to the Service and its components will remain
					with and belong exclusively to CloudBees. You shall not modify,
					adapt or hack the Service to falsely imply any sponsorship or
					association with CloudBees, or otherwise attempt to gain
					unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or
					networks.</p>
				<p>You are responsible for all information, data, text, messages
					or other materials that You post or otherwise transmit via the
					Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
					Your login and account and are fully responsible for any and all
					activities that occur under Your login or account. You agree and
					acknowledge that Your login may only be used by one (1) person – a
					single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may
					create separate logins for as many people as Your plan allows.</p>
				<p>CloudBees reserves the right to access any or all Your
					accounts in order to respond to Your requests for technical
					support. We shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical and
					technical safeguards for protection of the security,
					confidentiality and integrity of Your data. We will not disclose
					Your data except if compelled by law or if permitted by You.</p>
				<p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission
					of the Service, including Your content, may be transferred
					unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks;
					(b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
					connecting networks or devices and (c) transmission to CloudBees’s
					third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary
					hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology
					required to operate and maintain the Service. CloudBees will use
					reasonable efforts to publish on the site or notify You of any
					planned downtime of the Service.</p>
				<p>The failure of CloudBees to exercise or enforce any right or
					provision of this TOS shall not be a waiver of that right. You
					acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between You and CloudBees,
					even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by You
					and CloudBees, and it governs Your use of the Service and takes the
					place of any prior agreements between You and CloudBees.</p>

				<h3>Trademarks</h3>
				<p>CLOUDBEES® and CloudBees’s various logos used or displayed on
					the Service are trademarks of CloudBees and you may only use these
					trademarks or logos for promotional purposes to identify yourself
					as a customer or user of the CloudBees products and services,
					provided You do not attempt to claim ownership of the marks by
					incorporating any of them within Your names or offerings.</p>

				<h3>Payment and Refunds</h3>
				<p>
					<u>Trial and Payments</u>. The JaaS service is composed of (a) a
					set of general services made available on a pay-as-you-go basis and
					charged at the start of Your elected subscription term (generally
					monthly, quarterly or annually), including a Jenkins master
					instance, Forge services and the provision of Jenkins build agents
					instances and (b) a Jenkins-based job execution service (referred
					to here as "Jenkins usage") available on-demand and charged
					according to the actual usage time of this service and the type of
					build agent instance being used. Customers may choose to first
					subscribe to our special Trial plan that includes a seven-day free
					Dev+ subscription and up to seven hours of Jenkins usage. If you
					reach the seven-hour limit before the end of the Trial period, you
					will be redirected to our Account management service where you will
					be able to confirm that you accept to be charged for any additional
					time of Jenkins usage until the end of the seven-day Trial
					subscription. If you do not accept to be charged, Your account will
					be suspended and can only be reactivated by subscribing to either
					our Dev or Dev+ plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>Beta Programs</u>. During limited periods of time, CloudBees
					offers on its web site the opportunity to register for various Beta
					programs. Such programs allow companies or individuals to use new
					CloudBees offerings before their official General Availability (GA)
					date. It also allows CloudBees to collect user feedback prior to
					the GA date of a new offering. Such programs are by invitation
					only. Therefore, registering for a Beta program does not guarantee
					a participation in the program. Following registration, if a
					company or an individual is selected by CloudBees to join a
					specific Beta program, CloudBees sends an invitation email
					including the program's financial terms as well as practical
					information on how to get started or any other elements specific to
					the program. Each Beta program is made available for an undefined
					duration and might be terminated by CloudBees at any time, with a
					one-week notice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>Plan and Price Changes</u>. If you choose to upgrade Your plan
					during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will
					be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and
					charged to Your account. Subsequently, Your credit card will
					automatically be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing
					cycle subsequent to the pro-rating billing. Regardless of Your
					billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for partial months
					of service, plan downgrades, or refunds for months unused if You
					close Your account before the end of Your subscription period. No
					exceptions will be made in order to treat everyone equally and keep
					our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of our
					customer base. Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of
					content, features, or capacity of Your account and CloudBees does
					not accept any liability for such loss. Prices of all CloudBees
					plans and Services are subject to change upon 30 days notice from
					us. Such notice may be provided at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>Credit Card Billing, Receipts and Privacy</u>. The account owner
					will receive an email receipt upon each credit card charge. The
					receipts are also available for the account owner from within the
					application. CloudBees provides an interface for the account owner
					to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal).
					CloudBees uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card
					processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain,
					or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card
					information for CloudBees. Please visit <a
						href="http://www.cloudbees.com/company-privacy.cb">http://www.cloudbees.com/company-privacy.cb</a>
					to understand how CloudBees collects and uses personal information.
				</p>

				<h3>Cancellation and Termination</h3>
				<p>You are responsible for properly canceling Your account by
					sending a request to info@cloudbees.com. We will then contact Your
					account administrator and require a confirmation by replying to our
					email. There are no other means of canceling Your account. You will
					lose access to all of Your content upon cancellation and we will
					delete it in our normal course of business operations. This
					information cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled. If
					You cancel the Service before the end of Your current paid-up
					subscription period, your cancellation will take effect immediately
					and You will not be charged again. You will only be charged for the
					existing usage fees of Your account, if any.</p>
				<p>CloudBees reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue,
					temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and
					(ii) refuse any and all current and future use of the Service,
					suspend or terminate your account (any part thereof) or use of the
					Service and remove and discard any of Your content in the Service,
					for any reason, including, if CloudBees believes that You have
					violated these TOS. CloudBees will use all reasonable efforts to
					contact You directly via email to warn You prior to suspension or
					termination of Your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or
					illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of Your use of
					Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
					authorities. CloudBees shall not be liable to You or any third
					party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the
					Service.</p>

				<h3>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
				<p>THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER
					AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
					AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, TO THE FULLEST
					EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND CLOUDBEES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND
					ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
					LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE,
					FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU
					ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLOUDBEES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL
					BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE AND NO
					INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM CLOUDBEES OR THROUGH THE
					SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOS.</p>

				<h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
				<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN
					CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL CLOUDBEES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
					ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
					CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST
					SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. IN ADDITION,
					CLOUDBEES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES
					OR LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF THE MONTHLY SERVICE FEE PAID OR PAYABLE
					BY YOU FOR THE ONE MONTH PRECEDING THE TIME OF ANY CLAIM FOR
					MONETARY DAMAGES OR ONE HUNDRED ($100) U.S. DOLLARS. THE PROVISIONS
					OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS BETWEEN THE
					PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN
					DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
				<p>Some U.S. states do not allow the exclusion of implied
					warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
					consequential damages, which means that some of the above
					limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE STATES, CLOUDBEES’S
					LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

				<h3>Assignment</h3>
				<p>CloudBees may assign or transfer this TOS, in whole or in
					part, without restriction.</p>

				<h3>Export Compliance</h3>
				<p>You are responsible for complying with any applicable laws,
					rules, or regulations governing the export of the Service or any of
					its components.</p>

				<h3>Governing Law</h3>
				<p>These TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of
					Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. You
					hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal
					jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the State of
					Delaware for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to Your
					access to or use of the Service.</p>
